# Students & Companies (S&C) - Internship Matching Platform  
*Software Engineering 2 - Academic Year 2024-2025 - MCs project*  

## **Project Documentation & Content**  

This repository contains the **Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)** and the **Design Document (DD)** for the *Students & Companies (S&C) Platform*, a system designed to **match university students with internship opportunities** in an efficient and automated way.  

The project follows a structured **software engineering methodology**, where we first defined the **system requirements** in the RASD and then designed the **technical architecture** in the DD. These documents were developed following **rigorous software engineering principles** and based on **specific guidelines** provided in the project assignment.  

### **Project Scope & Goals**  
The goal of *Students & Companies (S&C)* is to bridge the gap between students looking for **internship opportunities** and companies offering them. The platform enhances the **matching process** using **recommendation algorithms** and allows:  
 -**Students** to create profiles, upload CVs, search for internships, and receive recommendations.  
 -**Companies** to post internship offers, search for candidates, and manage applications.  
 -**University Coordinators** to approve internships, oversee the process, and handle complaints.  


To document the system properly, we followed a two-step process:  

1. **RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)** → Focused on defining the **problem**, system requirements, and user needs.  
2. **DD (Design Document)** → Focused on the **technical design**, including system architecture, interaction models, and deployment strategies.

### **RASD - Requirements Analysis and Specification Document**  
The **RASD document** is used to formally define the **functional and non-functional requirements** of the system. It describes the problem domain, user interactions, and system constraints.  

The document is structured as follows:  

- **Introduction** – Defines the project’s **purpose, scope, and key references**.  
- **Overall Description** – Provides **scenarios, user interactions, and a high-level system model**.  
- **Specific Requirements** – Details **functional requirements, system attributes, and constraints**, using **use cases and UML diagrams**.  
- **Formal Analysis Using Alloy** – Uses **Alloy modeling** to verify the **consistency and correctness** of system requirements.  
- **Effort Spent** – Documents the **time contribution of each group member**.  
- **References** – Lists **external sources** and **supporting materials**.  

### **DD - Design Document**  
The **DD document** translates the system requirements defined in the RASD into a **technical architecture** that can be implemented. It provides a structured representation of the **system’s components, interactions, and deployment**.  

The document is structured as follows:  

- **Introduction** – Describes the **purpose, scope, and key references**.  
- **Architectural Design** – Defines the **system architecture**, including **component interactions, deployment strategy, and runtime behavior**.  
- **User Interface Design** – Provides an **overview of the system’s UI structure**.  
- **Requirements Traceability** – Maps the **requirements from the RASD** to **design elements** in the DD.  
- **Implementation, Integration, and Test Plan** – Describes the **phases of system implementation and testing strategy**.  
- **Effort Spent** – Documents the **time contribution of each group member**.  
- **References** – Lists **external sources** and **supporting materials**.
