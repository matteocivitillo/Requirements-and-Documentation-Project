# Students & Companies (S&C) - Internship Matching Platform  
*Software Engineering 2 - Academic Year 2024-2025 - MCs project*  

## **Project Documentation & Content**  

This repository contains the **Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)** and the **Design Document (DD)** for the *Students & Companies (S&C) Platform*, a system designed to **match university students with internship opportunities** in an efficient and automated way.  

The project follows a structured **software engineering methodology**, where we first defined the **system requirements** in the RASD and then designed the **technical architecture** in the DD. These documents were developed following **rigorous software engineering principles** and based on **specific guidelines** provided in the project assignment.  

### **Project Scope & Goals**  
The goal of *Students & Companies (S&C)* is to bridge the gap between students looking for **internship opportunities** and companies offering them. The platform enhances the **matching process** using **recommendation algorithms** and allows:  
 -**Students** to create profiles, upload CVs, search for internships, and receive recommendations.  
 -**Companies** to post internship offers, search for candidates, and manage applications.  
 -**University Coordinators** to approve internships, oversee the process, and handle complaints.  


To document the system properly, we followed a two-step process:  

1. **RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)** → Focused on defining the **problem**, system requirements, and user needs.  
2. **DD (Design Document)** → Focused on the **technical design**, including system architecture, interaction models, and deployment strategies.  




## **RASD - Requirements Analysis and Specification Document**  
The **RASD** provides a **detailed analysis** of the system's **functional** and **non-functional requirements**. It is structured as follows:  

### **1. Introduction**  
- Overview of the project’s **purpose** and **scope**.  
- Definitions of **key terms, acronyms, and abbreviations**.  
- Reference documents used in the analysis.  

### **2. Overall Description**  
- **Scenarios and use cases** to illustrate user interactions.  
- **Class and state diagrams** to define core system entities.  
- Definition of **shared and world-controlled phenomena** (actions taken by users vs. system automation).  

### **3. Specific Requirements**  
- **Detailed functional requirements**, structured as **use cases** and **UML diagrams**.  
- **Performance constraints**, including response times and system availability.  
- **Non-functional requirements**, such as security, maintainability, and scalability.  

### **4. Formal Analysis using Alloy**  
- A **formal specification of the system** using **Alloy modeling** to validate the consistency of the requirements.  
- **Assertions and constraints** to verify the correctness of relationships and interactions between entities.  





## **DD - Design Document**  
The **DD** translates the **requirements** defined in the RASD into a **technical design** that can be implemented.  

### **1. Introduction**  
- Explanation of **design choices** and constraints.  
- **Architectural overview** of the system.  

### **2. High-Level Architecture**  
- **System components** and their **interactions**.  
- **UML diagrams** (Class diagrams, Sequence diagrams, State diagrams).  
- **Data management models** (database structure, API endpoints).  

### **3. Detailed Design**  
- **Frontend & backend interaction models**.  
- **External system integrations** (authentication, notifications, recommendation engine).  
- **Deployment considerations** (cloud hosting, scalability strategies).  

### **4. Security & Maintainability**  
- **Security policies** to protect user data.  
- **Modularity and maintainability principles** for long-term system support.
